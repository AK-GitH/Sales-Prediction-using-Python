# Sales Prediction using Python

This project demonstrates how to **predict product sales** based on advertising expenditure across three media channels: **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**. It uses **Linear Regression**, a foundational machine learning algorithm, to model the relationship between advertising spend and resulting sales.

## Project Description

> **Sales prediction** involves estimating future product sales based on factors such as how much is spent on advertising and which platforms are used.

This project analyzes historical advertising data (`Advertising.csv`) and builds a linear model to predict future sales performance.

## Files Included

- `Advertising.csv` 
- `clean_data.py` â€” Script to clean the raw data:
  - Saves a new cleaned dataset as `cleaned_advertising.csv`
- `sales_prediction.py`

### 1. Install Required Packages

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
### 2. Run the `clean_data.py` which will clean the data and then run `sales_prediction.py`
